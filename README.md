# Serving a Pytorch model as a RESTful API by FastAPI
This repository is a demonstration on how you can develop a simple endpoint using FastAPI to serve a Pytorch model as an independent service. The process is almost the same for any other intelligent model.

## 1. Introduction

Intelligent methods are developed to be used and Jupyter/Colab notebooks are far from being ideal for the production stage. On the other hand, deployment through **Model as a Service** or [MasS](https://medium.com/@pearcenjordan/what-is-maas-unlock-the-power-of-model-as-a-service-27ebbcaefce6) is one of the favourite options. The main aim of this repository is to deploy a Pytorch model as an individual service, using FastAPI. We start from structurizing a benchmark bearing fault diagnosis dataset; then, we design, implement, train and evaluate a deep learning model to diagnose the bearing. Next is to develop a RESTful API using FastAPI to serve the model. Last but not least, we deploy the whole application on [render.com](https://render.com/).
